The rule of the game is as follows:
1. Every team has an initial account of 1 million cash, your team can use this cash to buy or sell assets to build a hyperportfolio, the target of the game is to maximize the asset, which is the summation of the remaining cash and the value of an asset you own
2. A hyperportfolio is composed of a set of assets that corresponds to the time series in different domains from real-life covers financial market close prices, economic time series, Google search trends, and political and public opinion poll trackers. 
3. The game begins on 2021-10-01 and ends on 2023-08-01, after beginning, the time will move forward, and you will consistently receive real-life news about what is happening in the world, newly released opinions from the internet or social network, or reports from research institutes, financial institutions, and so on.
4. Your team may choose to "buy" or "sell" an asset during the game. Each asset corresponds to a time series, the buy price will be the latest value of the time series at the current time. 
5. You need to pay a commission when you buy or sell an asset, the amount is about 1% of the buy or sell value. 
6. The value of an asset you own will update over time, calculated as (current price/buy price)*(investment amount).
